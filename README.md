## Welcome to Gabriele Zannini's GitHub page! üî•

Hi! My name is Gabriele and i'm a Full Stack Developer. I found in coding an absolute obsession, and my goal is to make the world a better place one line of code at a time. I like to create useful applications that can improve the quality of life as much as possible. I also enjoy checking the latest techs in the field, it's amazing what a "few" lines of code can create.

Currently obsessing over ChatGPT, who knows what will come out from that ;)
